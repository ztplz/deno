# The Rust compiler normally builds source code directly into an executable.
# Internally, object code is produced, and then the (system) linker is called,
# but this all happens under the covers.
#
# However Deno's build system uses it's own linker. For it to successfully
# produce an executable from rustc-generated object code, it needs to link
# with a dozen or so "built-in" Rust libraries (as in: not Cargo crates),
# and we need to tell the linker which and where those .rlibs are.
#
# Hard-coding these libraries into the GN configuration isn't possible: the
# required .rlib files have some sort of hash code in their file name, and their
# location depends on how Rust is set up, and which toolchain is active.
#
# So instead, we have this script: it writes a list of linker options (ldflags)
# to stdout, separated by newline characters. It is called from `rust.gni` when
# GN is generating ninja files (it doesn't run in the build phase).
#
# There is no official way through which rustc will give us the information
# we need, so a "back door" is used. We tell `rustc` to compile a (dummy)
# program, and to use a custom linker. This "linker" doesn't actually link
# anything; it just dumps it's argv to a temporary file. When rustc is done,
# this script then reads the linker arguments from that temporary file, and
# then filters it to remove flags that are irrelevant or undesirable.
